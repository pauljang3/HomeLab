# Home Lab: Active Directory and Networking Project

Welcome to my Home Lab project repository! This repository showcases my journey in setting up and configuring a virtualized Active Directory environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with domain management, networking, and automation, all of which are essential for IT and Help Desk roles.

## Key Features

- **Active Directory Setup**:  
  - Configured a fully functional Domain Controller with Windows Server 2019.  
  - Created and managed Organizational Units (OUs), user accounts, and groups.

- **Networking**:  
  - Set up DHCP and NAT for seamless connectivity.  
  - Used Remote Access Services (RAS) to enable the client machine to access the internet through the Domain Controller.

- **Automation**:  
  - Wrote and executed PowerShell scripts to automate the creation of 1,000+ user accounts.
